Syntax Error project- "Transcribe"

Effortlessly convert spoken words to written text and back with our speech-to-text and text-to-speech project.

The problem Transcribe solves
---> Accessibility: Enhance inclusivity by providing text-to-speech capabilities for those with visual impairments, ensuring they can consume digital content effortlessly.

---> Translation: Seamlessly convert spoken language into written text and vice versa, facilitating real-time multilingual communication and content localization.

---> Voice Commands: Enable hands-free control of devices and applications through speech recognition, improving user convenience and safety while driving or operating equipment.

Challenges we ran into
---> We faced several issues regarding speechRecognition.js .
---> We were able to complile the code and also upload the extension (earlier our idea was to make to a chrome extension), but the buttons were not working.
---> We also couldn't take much help from google and youtube tutorials, as all the codes were available for manifest v2.
---> We then decided to make a webpage but faced issues in making a perfect textbox for taking input; as the input text was being taken in one single line and not a paragraph.(though we cracked this issue finally :)
